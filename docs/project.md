## Introduction

**TrustyStack** is a hardware benchmarking platform that provides professionals with insights into the performance of various hardware configurations in real-world industry software environments. The platform aims to bridge the gap between hardware specifications and practical performance metrics, enabling informed decision-making for hardware investments.

---

## Project Structure

TrustyStack is organized into several key components:

- **Backend Services:**
  - **Rust API Server:** High-performance API built with Rust, leveraging frameworks like Actix-Web and Diesel.
  - **Python Utilities:** Scripts and tools for data processing and analysis.
- **Frontend Applications:**
  - **Web Application:** Built with React for browser-based interactions.
  - **Native Application:** Mobile app developed using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** Centralized database for storing benchmarking data and user information.
- **Infrastructure:**
  - **Docker & Docker Compose:** Containerization for consistent environments.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated workflows using GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.
  - **Secrets Management:** Secure handling of sensitive information.

### Repository Layout

- `backend/`
  - `rust/`: Rust API server source code.
  - `python/`: Python scripts and utilities.
- `frontend/`
  - `web/`: React web application.
  - `native/`: React Native mobile application.
- `infra/`
  - `cicd/`: CI/CD pipeline configurations and scripts.
- `docs/`: Project documentation and guidelines.
- `Makefile`: Automation scripts for common tasks.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch (`main`):** Stable code ready for production.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/*`):** New features or experiments.
- **Release Branches (`release/*`):** Preparing for a new production release.
- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`):** Quick fixes for production issues.

### Code Review Process

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** From your feature branch to `main`.
2. **Automated Tests:** CI/CD pipelines run automated tests.
3. **Peer Review:** At least one other developer must approve the PR.
4. **Merge:** After approval and passing tests, the PR can be merged.

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive git@github.com:TrustyStack/TrustyStack.git
   cd TrustyStack
   ```

2. **Initialize Submodules:**

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - **Backend:** Install Rust and Cargo packages.
   - **Frontend:** Install Node.js packages using `npm` or `yarn`.
   - **Database:** Ensure PostgreSQL is installed or use Docker for containerization.

4. **Run Services:**
   - Use Docker Compose to start dependent services.
   - Use the `Makefile` for simplified commands, e.g., `make dev`.

## Dependencies Management

### Programming Languages and Frameworks

- **Rust:** For high-performance backend services.
- **Python:** For scripting and data processing.
- **React & React Native:** For frontend web and mobile applications.

### Package Managers

- **Cargo:** For Rust dependencies.
- **npm/yarn:** For JavaScript dependencies.

### Managing Dependencies

- **Version Pinning:** Specify exact versions in `Cargo.toml` and `package.json` to ensure consistency.
- **Submodules:** Use Git submodules for shared components across services.
- **Automation Scripts:** Utilize the `Makefile` to automate dependency installation and updates.

---

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### CI/CD Pipelines

- **GitHub Actions:** Used for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Workflows:**
  - **Build and Test:** On every PR and commit to `main`.
  - **Deployment:** Triggered on merges to `main` or when a new tag is pushed.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and modules.
- **Integration Tests:** For interactions between different parts of the system.
- **End-to-End Tests:** For user flows in frontend applications.

### Deployment Environments

- **Development:** For testing new features; uses development configurations.
- **Staging:** A mirror of production for final testing.
- **Production:** Live environment for end-users.

---

## Secrets and Configuration Management

### Secrets Handling

- **GitHub Secrets:** Securely store API keys, passwords, and tokens for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files for local development, which are excluded from version control.

### Best Practices

- **No Hardcoding:** Never commit secrets to the repository.
- **Access Control:** Limit access to secrets based on roles.
- **Rotation:** Regularly update and rotate secrets.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Docker and Containerization

- **Docker Images:** Create consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Docker Compose:** Manage multi-container applications.

### Rolling Updates

- **Zero Downtime:** Use rolling updates to deploy new versions without interrupting service.
- **Versioning:** Tag Docker images with version numbers.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Logging:** Centralize logs for analysis and debugging.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Implement tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics.

---

## Maintenance and Support

### Scheduled Maintenance

- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies and systems up-to-date.
- **Backup Plans:** Regular database backups and recovery plans.

### Issue Tracking

- **GitHub Issues:** Use for tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
- **Labels and Milestones:** Organize issues by priority and release cycles.
